<!-- I grew up in a small town in eastern NC. My wife and I now live in Cambridge, MA and have loved every construction-filled minute of it. -->

When I'm not working you can find me:
* Cooking / eating
* Running
* Cycling
* Spending time with friends and family
<!-- * Traveling -->
<!-- * Enjoying the outdoors -->
<!-- * Hiking -->
* Exploring new places
<!-- * Eating some more -->
<!-- * Wishing I had a dog -->
* Programming
* Losing to my mom in fantasy football
<!-- * Watching Netflix -->
