I am a fourth-year accounting Ph.D.  at Boston College, Carroll School of Management. I will be on the 2022-2023 academic job market.

I'm interested in the intersection between voluntary disclosure and information intermediaries, particularly the interactions between management and sell-side equity research analysts. I am particularly interested in the determinants of firmsâ€™ information environments and the efficient allocation of capital.

Prior to joining the Ph.D. program at Boston College, I completed a master of accountancy at Brigham Young University where I also received a Bachelor of Science in accounting and a minor in economics.

I spend my free time with my wife, three-year old son, and new-born daughter. When I'm not with them or working, I am playing any sport. I recently completed my first marathon and one day soon I hope to compete in the Boston Marathon.
