I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Accounting at Northeastern University.

I'm interested in the intersection of voluntary disclosure and information intermediaries, particularly in the incentives and consequences around managers' (1) disclosure choices and (2) interactions with sell-side analysts and investors. I seek to understand the determinants of firmsâ€™ information environments and the efficient allocation of capital.

Prior to joining Northeastern University, I completed my Ph.D. in Accounting at Boston College and my MS and BS in Accounting at Brigham Young University where I also received a minor in economics.

I spend my free time with my wife, five-year old son, and one-year old daughter. When I'm not with them or working, I am playing any sport. I recently completed my first marathon and I hope to eventually qualify to compete in the Boston Marathon.
