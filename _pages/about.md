I am a fifth-year accounting Ph.D. candidate at Boston College, Carroll School of Management. I am on the 2022-2023 academic job market.

I'm interested in the intersection of voluntary disclosure and information intermediaries, particularly in the incentives and consequences around managers' disclosure choices and managers interactions with sell-side analysts and investors. I seek to understand the determinants of firmsâ€™ information environments and the efficient allocation of capital.

Prior to joining the Ph.D. program at Boston College, I completed the Master's of Accountancy at Brigham Young University where I also received a Bachelor of Science in accounting and a minor in economics.

I spend my free time with my wife, four-year old son, and nine-month old daughter. When I'm not with them or working, I am playing any sport. I recently completed my first marathon and I hope to eventually qualify to compete in the Boston Marathon.
