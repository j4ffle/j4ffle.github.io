### *"Financial Reporting Candor: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"* (JMP)
Summary: I examine whether managers successfully develop a reputation to be candid with bad news and whether this reputation for candor fosters increased levels of trust from investors. I capture managers’ candor using their propensity to engage in discussions with bearish analysts on earnings conference calls. Signaling theory suggests that candid managers can separate themselves by sending a costly signal (such as voluntarily facing hard questions that increase scrutiny during a conference call) that other managers are unable or unwilling to send. I find results consistent with investors identifying candid managers and rewarding them with greater trust. This trust is evidenced in lower negative spillovers from peers’ financial restatements and increased liquidity for more candid managers.

### *"Predictability of Analyst Stock Recommendation Revisions"* with Mark Bradshaw and Mark Piorkowski
Summary: On average, analysts’ stock recommendation revisions have immediate effects on stock prices. However, recent research indicates that only a small subset of recommendations are influential in the sense that they are associated with significant returns. Given the relative infrequency of recommendation revisions, we predict that analysts signal future recommendation revisions through changes in the tone of sequential research reports, which preempts market reactions when revisions are announced. We find that the signed change in tone of analysts’ reports is positively associated with future recommendation revisions. Using the change in research report tone and other determinants, we construct a measure of the likelihood of a recommendation revision. This predictability measure is associated with attenuated market reactions to recommendation upgrades and a lower likelihood that the upgrades are classified as influential. We also find that our recommendation revision prediction model is better at predicting upgrades than downgrades and has similar performance to fraud prediction models in the literature.

<!-- ### Future Work

Some topics that I hope to explore in the future include the role of corporate disclosures in managing climate and sustainability efforts as well as the use of accounting information by less traditional stakeholders such as consumers and employees. I am very interested in the risks posed by climate change as well as the movement towards sustainability and inclusion. Given the increasing supply and access of accounting information as well as the rapidly evolving regulatory and disclosure landscape with respect to climate goals, I feel that research on these topics is compelling and has the potential to answer questions of economic significance. -->
