### *"Why Do Managers Interact with Unfavorable Analysts during Earnings Calls?"* (JMP)

Paper available upon request.

Abstract: Managers tend to prioritize questions from favorable analysts during earnings announcement conference calls, reinforcing analysts’ incentives to be optimistic. However, managers also interact with unfavorable analysts on calls and when they do, absolute announcement returns are larger. I seek to understand why managers interact with unfavorable analysts. I find the negative views of unfavorable analysts attenuate after interactions with managers during earnings calls. Additionally, the stock price response is stronger for forecasts from managers who regularly interact with unfavorable analysts, consistent with enhanced credibility of these managers. Finally, I use peer firm restatement announcements as exogenous shocks to investors’ assessment of a firm’s accounting quality. I find that non-restating firms with managers who regularly interact with unfavorable analysts experience attenuated negative returns relative to non-restating peers. Overall, my findings are consistent with managers’ interactions with unfavorable analysts providing significant benefits to the firm, such as resolving concerns and increasing investors’ perceptions of manager credibility.

### *"Predictability of Analyst Stock Recommendation Revisions"* with Mark Bradshaw and Mark Piorkowski

Paper available upon request.

Abstract: On average, analysts’ stock recommendation revisions have immediate effects on stock prices. However, recent research indicates that only a small subset of recommendations are influential in the sense that they are associated with significant returns. Given the relative infrequency of recommendation revisions compared to other analyst output, we expect that analysts predictably signal future recommendation revisions through changes in the tone of sequential research reports and quantitative forecasts. Consistent with our expectation, we find that future recommendation revisions are positively associated with the signed change in analyst report tone, expected returns implied from target prices, and target price revisions. To test whether the predictability of recommendation revisions preempts market reactions when revisions are announced, we construct a predictability measure using changes in research report tone, analysts’ quantitative output, and firm characteristics. We find that our predictability measure is associated with attenuated market reactions to recommendation upgrades and a lower likelihood that the upgrades are classified as influential. We also find that our recommendation revision prediction model is better at predicting upgrades than downgrades and has similar performance to prediction models in other settings in the literature predicting rare events, such as fraud prediction models.

### *"Analysts’ Role in Managerial Learning: Evidence from Analyst Activity around M&A Announcements"* with Farzana Afrin


Paper available upon request.

Abstract: We examine the impact of sell-side analysts’ research on the re-evaluation of M&A deals. We construct and use a measure of analyst tone to examine the soft information contained in a large sample of 14,000 analyst reports issued shortly after M&A deal announcements. We find that a more positive analyst tone is associated with a higher likelihood of deal completion, consistent with deal participants learning from analyst reports. Moreover, the effect is stronger when analysts have more experience covering the firms involved in the deal, and when there is greater managerial uncertainty surrounding the deal. We also find that more positive analyst reports are associated with a shorter time to deal completion. Last, we find that more positive analyst reports are associated with fewer target shareholder activist campaigns opposing the deal, consistent with target shareholders learning from analyst reports. Overall, our findings suggest that key decision-makers learn about the merits of the deal from analysts.

<!-- ### Future Work

Some topics that I hope to explore in the future include the role of corporate disclosures in managing climate and sustainability efforts as well as the use of accounting information by less traditional stakeholders such as consumers and employees. I am very interested in the risks posed by climate change as well as the movement towards sustainability and inclusion. Given the increasing supply and access of accounting information as well as the rapidly evolving regulatory and disclosure landscape with respect to climate goals, I feel that research on these topics is compelling and has the potential to answer questions of economic significance. -->
