### *"Why Do Managers Interact with Unfavorable Analysts during Earnings Calls?"* (JMP)

*Revise and Resubmit* at the *Journal of Accounting Research*

Managers prioritize favorable analysts during earnings calls, reinforcing analysts’ incentives for optimism. However, managers also interact with unfavorable analysts, and this study examines why managers engage in these interactions by exploring their consequences. I propose two non-mutually exclusive possibilities, that managers (1) directly address concerns of unfavorable analysts and (2) develop a reputation for credibility. I document evidence consistent with both. First, unfavorable analysts attenuate their negative views after interacting with managers. Second, price responses to management forecasts are stronger for managers who regularly interact with unfavorable analysts, consistent with enhanced credibility of these managers. Also, because not all managers forecast, I use peer firm restatements as exogenous shocks to perceptions of accounting quality and find that nonrestating firms with managers who regularly interact with unfavorable analysts experience attenuated negative returns relative to other nonrestating peers. Overall, the findings are consistent with managers’ interactions with unfavorable analysts providing significant benefits.

### *"Consequences of Implied Analyst Recommendation Revisions in Reiteration Research Reports"* with Mark Bradshaw, Chad Hamm, and Mark Piorkowski

Under review at *The Journal of Accounting Research*

Over 90% of analysts’ stock recommendations reiterate prior recommendations, but most research on recommendations examines the small subset of actual revisions. Analysts are reluctant to revise recommendations and other forecasts, either to placate managers or avoid a pattern of ‘see-saw’ research outputs. We predict that an analyst may signal a change in sentiment without actually revising the outstanding recommendation. Indeed, we show that reiterations we identify as “implied recommendation revisions” predict actual future recommendation revisions. The market impounds such information into prices—implied upgrades (downgrades) are positively (negatively) associated with returns centered on the report date, and price reactions to actual recommendation revisions are attenuated when preceded by an implied recommendation revision. We also show that sophisticated investors are more likely to trade after implied recommendation revisions, whereas retail traders tend to trade around actual recommendation revisions. Overall, our evidence provides extended insight into analysts’ research, the dynamics of recommendations, and the market consequences of both recommendation reiterations and revisions.

### *"The Credibility of Non-Disclosure: Evidence from Real-time Market Response to Non-Answers in Conference Calls"* with Yang Cao and Miao Liu

Managers sometimes give non-disclosure to investors despite their best intentions, either due to a lack of information or substantial proprietary costs. However, it is difficult for investors to distinguish these managers from those hiding negative news. This paper investigates whether managers can establish a transparent disclosure reputation to credibly communicate the absence of information, using non-answers during earnings calls as a setting. By matching granular, time-stamped earnings call conversations with high-frequency trading data, we create a novel dataset that examines immediate real-time market reactions to non-answers given by managers. Additionally, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to build a database of strategies that managers adopt to establish a transparent disclosure reputation, including providing detailed elaboration when issuing negative earnings guidance and proactively interacting with bearish analysts. We find that these disclosure strategies bolster managers’ credibility when communicating the absence of information. Our study highlights the importance of disclosure strategies that managers can adopt to ensure credible communication within the dynamic context of real-time scenarios.

### *"Real Effects of Analysts’ Information Role: Evidence from M&As"* with Farzana Afrin and Jalal Sani

Completing an M&A deal with negative announcement returns can have significant negative consequences for the manager (e.g., forced turnover), yet, managers complete more than 90% of such deals. We build on prior research to propose two explanations and examine the role of analyst research in each explanation,  using analyst distraction by exploiting exogenous shocks to other firms the analyst follows as an inverse measure for analyst research. First, investors may not possess all relevant information at the deal announcement and thus may revise their opinion upwards post-announcement, lowering managerial costs of deal completion. Under this explanation, analysts can play an informational role where they provide investors with new information. We find that analyst research prompts investors to revise their opinion upwards, increasing deal completion likelihood, specifically when the deal quality is high and analysts are more informed. Second, inefficient external monitoring can enable managers to pursue value-destroying deals. Under this explanation, we find analysts act as a monitoring mechanism by providing negative information about the deal, decreasing deal completion likelihood, especially when agency friction is high. The dual roles of analysts have opposing effects, and we document that their informational role dominates the monitoring role. Overall, our findings highlight the significant impact of analysts’ informational role on managerial real investment decisions.

<!-- ### Future Work

Some topics that I hope to explore in the future include the role of corporate disclosures in managing climate and sustainability efforts as well as the use of accounting information by less traditional stakeholders such as consumers and employees. I am very interested in the risks posed by climate change as well as the movement towards sustainability and inclusion. Given the increasing supply and access of accounting information as well as the rapidly evolving regulatory and disclosure landscape with respect to climate goals, I feel that research on these topics is compelling and has the potential to answer questions of economic significance. -->
