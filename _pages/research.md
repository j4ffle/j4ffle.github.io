### *"Why Do Managers Interact with Unfavorable Analysts during Earnings Calls?"* (JMP)

*Revise and Resubmit* at the *Journal of Accounting Research*

Managers prioritize favorable analysts during earnings calls, reinforcing analysts’ incentives for optimism. However, managers also interact with unfavorable analysts, and this study examines why managers engage in these interactions by exploring their consequences. I propose two non-mutually exclusive possibilities, that managers (1) directly address concerns of unfavorable analysts and (2) develop a reputation for credibility. I document evidence consistent with both. First, unfavorable analysts attenuate their negative views after interacting with managers. Second, price responses to management forecasts are stronger for managers who regularly interact with unfavorable analysts, consistent with enhanced credibility of these managers. Also, because not all managers forecast, I use peer firm restatements as exogenous shocks to perceptions of accounting quality and find that nonrestating firms with managers who regularly interact with unfavorable analysts experience attenuated negative returns relative to other nonrestating peers. Overall, the findings are consistent with managers’ interactions with unfavorable analysts providing significant benefits.

### *"Predictability of Analyst Stock Recommendation Revisions"* with Mark Bradshaw, Chad Hamm, and Mark Piorkowski

Uder review at *The Journal of Accounting Research*

On average, analysts’ stock recommendation revisions have immediate effects on stock prices. However, recent research suggests that only a small subset of recommendations are influential in the sense that they are associated with significant short-window returns. We attempt to reconcile these findings by examining the predictability of recommendation revisions. Because analysts experience frictions in frequently revising recommendations, we predict that analysts signal future revisions through changes in the tone and quantitative forecasts of sequential reiteration reports, possibly preempting market reactions to subsequent revisions. Indeed, future recommendation revisions are positively associated with the signed change in analyst report tone, the level of forecasted returns, and target price revisions. We identify reiteration recommendations but with reports that imply future revisions and show they are significantly positively associated with short-term market reactions. Upgrades preceded by implied revisions are associated with attenuated market reactions and a lower likelihood of being classified as influential, consistent with investors preempting returns to the subsequent upgrades. Our model is better at predicting upgrades than downgrades and has performance commensurate with prediction models in other settings.

### *"The Credibility of Complex and Evasive Answers in Conference Calls: a Real-time Market Response Approach"* with Yang Cao and Miao Liu

We study how managers can credibly communicate complex or the absence of information during earnings calls. We match granular time-stamped earnings call conversations with high-frequency trading data, resulting in a novel dataset that enables us to examine immediate real-time market reactions to distinct linguistic features within conversations between managers and analysts. We find that improved agency considerations, characterized by higher manager ownership and lower financial distress, bolsters managers' credibility when disseminating complex information. However, these measures offer limited efficacy in conveying non-information. Conversely, establishing a transparent disclosure reputation — evidenced by more accurate management forecasts and proactively engaging with bearish analysts — proves to be a robust alternative strategy for establishing credibility in communicating both complex and absent information. Our study sheds light on strategies that managers can adopt to ensure credible communication within the dynamic context of real-time scenarios.

### *"Analysts’ Role in Managerial Learning: Evidence from Analyst Activity around M&A Announcements"* with Farzana Afrin

Abstract: We examine the impact of sell-side analysts’ research on the re-evaluation of M&A deals. We construct and use a measure of analyst tone to examine the soft information contained in a large sample of 14,000 analyst reports issued shortly after M&A deal announcements. We find that a more positive analyst tone is associated with a higher likelihood of deal completion, consistent with deal participants learning from analyst reports. Moreover, the effect is stronger when analysts have more experience covering the firms involved in the deal, and when there is greater managerial uncertainty surrounding the deal. We also find that more positive analyst reports are associated with a shorter time to deal completion. Last, we find that more positive analyst reports are associated with fewer target shareholder activist campaigns opposing the deal, consistent with target shareholders learning from analyst reports. Overall, our findings suggest that key decision-makers learn about the merits of the deal from analysts.

<!-- ### Future Work

Some topics that I hope to explore in the future include the role of corporate disclosures in managing climate and sustainability efforts as well as the use of accounting information by less traditional stakeholders such as consumers and employees. I am very interested in the risks posed by climate change as well as the movement towards sustainability and inclusion. Given the increasing supply and access of accounting information as well as the rapidly evolving regulatory and disclosure landscape with respect to climate goals, I feel that research on these topics is compelling and has the potential to answer questions of economic significance. -->
