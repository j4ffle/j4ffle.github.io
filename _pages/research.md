### *"Why Do Managers Interact with Unfavorable Analysts during Earnings Calls?"* (JMP)

Paper available upon request.

Managers prioritize questions from favorable analysts during earnings announcement conference calls, reinforcing analysts’ incentives to be optimistic. However, managers also interact with unfavorable analysts on calls, and this study examines why managers engage in these interactions by exploring their consequences. I propose two non-mutually exclusive possibilities, that managers directly address concerns of unfavorable analysts and/or develop a reputation for credibility. I document evidence consistent with both. First, unfavorable analysts attenuate their negative views after their interactions with managers. Second, price responses to management forecasts are stronger for managers who regularly interact with unfavorable analysts, consistent with enhanced credibility of these managers. Also, because not all managers forecast, I use peer firm restatement announcements as exogenous shocks to investors’ assessment of a firm’s accounting quality, and I find that nonrestating firms with managers who regularly interact with unfavorable analysts experience attenuated negative returns relative to other nonrestating peers. Overall, the findings are consistent with managers’ interactions with unfavorable analysts providing significant benefits to the firm.

### *"Predictability of Analyst Stock Recommendation Revisions"* with Mark Bradshaw and Mark Piorkowski

Under review at the *Journal of Accounting and Economics*

Paper available upon request.

Abstract: On average, analysts’ stock recommendation revisions have immediate effects on stock prices. However, recent research indicates that only a small subset of recommendations are influential in the sense that they are associated with significant returns. Given the relative infrequency of recommendation revisions compared to other analyst output, we expect that analysts predictably signal future recommendation revisions through changes in the tone of sequential research reports and quantitative forecasts. Consistent with our expectation, we find that future recommendation revisions are positively associated with the signed change in analyst report tone, expected returns implied from target prices, and target price revisions. To test whether the predictability of recommendation revisions preempts market reactions when revisions are announced, we construct a predictability measure using changes in research report tone, analysts’ quantitative output, and firm characteristics. We find that our predictability measure is associated with attenuated market reactions to recommendation upgrades and a lower likelihood that the upgrades are classified as influential. We also find that our recommendation revision prediction model is better at predicting upgrades than downgrades and has similar performance to prediction models in other settings in the literature predicting rare events, such as fraud prediction models.

### *"The Credibility of Complex and Evasive Answers in Conference Calls: a Real-time Market Response Approach"* with Yang Cao and Miao Liu

Paper available upon request.

We study how managers can credibly communicate complex or the absence of information during earnings calls. We match granular time-stamped earnings call conversations with high-frequency trading data, resulting in a novel dataset that enables us to examine immediate real-time market reactions to distinct linguistic features within conversations between managers and analysts. We find that improved agency considerations, characterized by higher manager ownership and lower financial distress, bolsters managers' credibility when disseminating complex information. However, these measures offer limited efficacy in conveying non-information. Conversely, establishing a transparent disclosure reputation — evidenced by more accurate management forecasts and proactively engaging with bearish analysts — proves to be a robust alternative strategy for establishing credibility in communicating both complex and absent information. Our study sheds light on strategies that managers can adopt to ensure credible communication within the dynamic context of real-time scenarios.

### *"Analysts’ Role in Managerial Learning: Evidence from Analyst Activity around M&A Announcements"* with Farzana Afrin

Paper available upon request.

Abstract: We examine the impact of sell-side analysts’ research on the re-evaluation of M&A deals. We construct and use a measure of analyst tone to examine the soft information contained in a large sample of 14,000 analyst reports issued shortly after M&A deal announcements. We find that a more positive analyst tone is associated with a higher likelihood of deal completion, consistent with deal participants learning from analyst reports. Moreover, the effect is stronger when analysts have more experience covering the firms involved in the deal, and when there is greater managerial uncertainty surrounding the deal. We also find that more positive analyst reports are associated with a shorter time to deal completion. Last, we find that more positive analyst reports are associated with fewer target shareholder activist campaigns opposing the deal, consistent with target shareholders learning from analyst reports. Overall, our findings suggest that key decision-makers learn about the merits of the deal from analysts.

<!-- ### Future Work

Some topics that I hope to explore in the future include the role of corporate disclosures in managing climate and sustainability efforts as well as the use of accounting information by less traditional stakeholders such as consumers and employees. I am very interested in the risks posed by climate change as well as the movement towards sustainability and inclusion. Given the increasing supply and access of accounting information as well as the rapidly evolving regulatory and disclosure landscape with respect to climate goals, I feel that research on these topics is compelling and has the potential to answer questions of economic significance. -->
